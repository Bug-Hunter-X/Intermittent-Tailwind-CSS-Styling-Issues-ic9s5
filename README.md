# Intermittent Tailwind CSS Styling Issues

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes intermittently fail to apply styles. The problem is not consistent across all elements; some elements correctly apply styles while others don't, even with identical classes.

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` file contains a simple example where a div element should have a red background (`bg-red-500`) and padding (`p-4`). However, in certain instances, these styles are not applied. This issue appears to be random and not tied to any specific element attributes.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a potential fix. Ensure you have all the necessary configurations in your `tailwind.config.js` file and that your CSS file is correctly importing Tailwind directives.
